# route_optimization_phase2
Development of route and scheduling optimization for driver dispatching and delivery 

# Short Description
This project used Google Map API to pre-calculated the distance between each location point.
Then use unsupervised learning to cluster each location.
Finally, used randomized algorithm to find the best route, schedule and dispatch the vehicle and driver.
